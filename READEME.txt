2. install nodes
3. navigate to the folder location using terminal / command prompt
4. execute "node challenge.js"

Functions
There is function by the name "readInput" in challenge.js file which is a starting point to the solution.
This function reads the data in a specific format as in the data.txt.
After the data is read, this method executes another function called "getAllRoutes()"
This is the common method for the problems 6 - 10 and needs parameters to be passed.

To see the solution for problems 1 - 5 comment out this method and uncomment the line 29 ( ////console.log(getRouteDistance('A-E-D')); )
and pass the path for which the distance is to be calculated.
